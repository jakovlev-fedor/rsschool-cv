### About me:

I've graduated Belarussian State Medical University in 2021. Amidst my education period I found myself questioning choices I've made in my teen years. At the beginning of the year of my graduation I've made my mind to shift from healthcare field to digital. <br>

For several years I've been in research of possibilities I have as a 'programmer-to-be'. I've tried Python first bundeled with Django, then I've read a success story of a Java developer and for half a year I was digging in a textbook. Now my aim is to grow as a professional in front-end field of web development.

I take RS School course for JavaSctript as it seem strustured well to stop wanderind around in the dark and finally land on my first job.
